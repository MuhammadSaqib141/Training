# Connecting Docker Compose Services Across Networks

## Description

Can a local Docker Compose service container connect to a container running in another cluster?

### Answer:
- **In the same network:** Yes, containers can connect directly to each other.
- **In different networks:** Direct connection is not possible without additional configurations.
- **Using host mode and port mapping:** It's possible to connect across clusters by exposing ports on the host machine.

## Run Instructions

### Example 1: Connecting Containers in the Same Network

In this example, we create two services in a Docker Compose file. Since they are part of the same custom bridge network (`mynetwork`), they can communicate with each other.

File: `docker-compose.service1.yml`

In this setup, both containers will be able to reach each other via their container names, as they are part of the same `mynetwork`. You can run this setup by saving the file as `docker-compose.service1.yml` and running:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.service1.yml up
```

You can verify the connection using the container name `service1_container` from another container in the same network.

### Example 2: Using Host Mode and Port Mapping

To connect to a container in another cluster or host, you need to expose the container's ports and use host networking or appropriate port mapping.

File: `docker-compose.service2.yml`

If you map the ports of one container (for example, `8080:80`), the services running in other containers, even in different clusters, can access this container via the host IP and the exposed port.

### Steps to Connect:
1. **Run the Docker Compose File:** 
   Start the services in both clusters by running the corresponding `docker-compose` files:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.service1.yml up
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.service2.yml up
   ```

2. **Access the Service:**
   Use the host machine's IP and the exposed port (e.g., `http://host-ip:8080`) from another cluster or container to connect to the service running in `docker-compose.service1.yml`.
