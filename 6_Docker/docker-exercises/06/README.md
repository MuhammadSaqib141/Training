# Docker Container Naming Conflict

## Description

When running multiple Docker containers with the same name, you will encounter a conflict. Docker requires each container to have a unique name. This README will guide you through understanding the issue and resolving it.

## Run Instructions

Follow these steps to observe and resolve the naming conflict issue:

1. **Run the First Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -it --name=test1 alpine:latest date
   ```

   This command runs a new Docker container with the name `test1` using the Alpine image and executes the `date` command.

2. **Run the Second Container with the Same Name:**

   ```bash
   docker run -it --name=test1 alpine:latest date
   ```

   This command will fail because a container with the name `test1` already exists.

### Why Does This Not Work?

Docker requires container names to be unique. When you try to start a second container with the same name (`test1`), Docker cannot create it because the name is already in use by an existing container.

### How to Resolve the Naming Conflict

You can resolve the naming conflict in several ways:

1. **Use a Different Name for the Second Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -it --name=test2 alpine:latest date
   ```

   By using a different name (`test2`), Docker will create the new container without any conflicts.

2. **Remove the Existing Container Before Running a New One:**

   First, remove the existing container:

   ```bash
   docker rm test1
   ```

   Then, run the new container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --name=test1 alpine:latest date
   ```

   This approach removes the container with the conflicting name and allows you to use it again.

3. **Automatically Remove the Container After It Exits:**

   You can use the `--rm` flag to automatically remove the container when it exits:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --name=test1 alpine:latest date
   ```

change  name just name conflict (answer by me was)
docker run -it --name=test1 alpine:latest date
docker run -it --name=test2 alpine:latest date
