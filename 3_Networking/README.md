# Networking Questions Readme

## Overview

This document provides explanations and solutions to various networking questions. The focus is on subnetting, IP address assignments, and valid addresses within given network configurations.

## Topics Covered

1. **Addressing and Subnetting**
   - Understanding subnet masks and network prefixes
   - Calculating usable IP ranges
   - Dividing a network into smaller subnets

2. **OSI Layers**
   - **Layer 1: Physical Layer** - Deals with the physical connection between devices.
   - **Layer 2: Data Link Layer** - Handles MAC addresses and error detection/correction.
   - **Layer 3: Network Layer** - Manages IP addressing and routing.
   - **Layer 4: Transport Layer** - Ensures end-to-end communication, manages TCP/UDP.
   - **Layer 5: Session Layer** - Manages sessions between applications.
   - **Layer 6: Presentation Layer** - Translates data formats and encryption.
   - **Layer 7: Application Layer** - Provides network services to applications.

3. **TCP/UDP**
   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** - Connection-oriented, reliable, guarantees delivery.
   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** - Connectionless, faster, but no guarantee of delivery.

4. **DNS/DHCP/ARP**
   - **DNS (Domain Name System)** - Translates domain names to IP addresses.
   - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** - Assigns IP addresses dynamically to devices on a network.
   - **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** - Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses.

5. **NATting Practical Examples**
   - **NAT (Network Address Translation)** - Translates private IP addresses to a public IP address.
   - **Types of NAT:**
     - **Static NAT** - One-to-one mapping.
     - **Dynamic NAT** - Many-to-many mapping.
     - **PAT (Port Address Translation)** - Many-to-one mapping.

6. **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)**
   - **Concept** - Segments a physical network into multiple logical networks.
   - **Benefits** - Improved network management, security, and performance.

7. **ACL (Access Control Lists)**
   - **Purpose** - Defines rules to control traffic flow in and out of network interfaces.
   - **Types of ACLs:**
     - **Standard ACLs** - Filter traffic based on source IP address.
     - **Extended ACLs** - Filter traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and port numbers.
