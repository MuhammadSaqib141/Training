1) Writing your first Dockerfile.
    Create a dockerfile from alpine base image and install and configure awscli. 
    The proposal for this container is to run awscli commands, after that it should die. 
    You must provide the awscli command via entrypoint.

2) Docker registry
    Tag and push the docker image that you built to DockerHub. Don't forget to docker login first;

3) Docker in docker.
    Here we want you to know the docker inception capabilities, so please take a look at this page: https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind
    After you have your first docker blow mind, you can go and test that images to play with docker in docker.

4) Sharing the docker daemon
    Now that you know the inception of docker we are going to learn, how to share your host daemon to create more dockers, instead of doing docker in docker. 
    So the task here is to create a dockerfile, from alpine image base, and install the docker in it, but what we want is that when you execute the docker run command, 
    you share the docker daemon with v option, so after that you can start creating more containers from this containers.
