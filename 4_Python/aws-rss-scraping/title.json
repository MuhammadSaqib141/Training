Running on Graviton4 powered instances, SAP has measured up to 25% better performance for analytical workloads and up to 40% better performance for transactional workloads in comparison to the same workloads running on Graviton3 instances. X8g instances allow SAP to expand their Graviton-based usage to even larger memory bound solutions.</p> \n<p><strong>Electronic Design Automation</strong> \u2013 EDA workloads are central to the process of designing, testing, verifying, and taping out new generations of chips, including Graviton, Trainium, Inferentia, and those that form the building blocks for the Nitro System. AWS and many other chip makers have adopted the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">AWS Cloud</a> for these workloads, taking advantage of scale and elasticity to supply each phase of the design process with the appropriate amount of compute power. This allows engineers to innovate faster because they are not waiting for results. Here\u2019s a long-term snapshot from one of the clusters that was used to support development of Graviton4 in late 2022 and early 2023. As you can see this cluster runs at massive scale, with peaks as high as 5x normal usage:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87474 aligncenter\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/29/grav4_use.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"899\" height=\"273\"></p> \n<p>You can see bursts of daily and weekly activity, and then a jump in overall usage during the tape-out phase. The instances in the cluster are on the large end of the size spectrum so the peaks represent several hundred thousand cores running concurrently. This ability to spin up compute when we need it and down when we don\u2019t gives us access to unprecedented scale without a dedicated investment in hardware.</p> \n<p>The new X8g instances will allow us and our EDA customers to run even more workloads on Graviton processors, reducing costs and decreasing energy consumption, while also helping to get new products to market faster than ever.</p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br> X8g instances are available today in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and Europe (Frankfurt) AWS Regions in On Demand, Spot, Reserved Instance, Savings Plan, Dedicated Instance, and Dedicated Host form.

Set the default encryption configuration of your S3 directory bucket to SSE-KMS and specify your AWS KMS key. Remember, you can only use one customer managed key per S3 directory bucket for its lifetime.</p> \n<p><strong>Regions&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 S3 Express One Zone support for SSE-KMS using customer managed keys is available in all <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-Endpoints.html\">AWS Regions where S3 Express One Zone is currently available</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Performance</strong> \u2013 Using SSE-KMS with S3 Express One Zone does not impact request latency. You\u2019ll continue to experience the same single-digit millisecond data access.</p> \n<p><strong>Pricing</strong> \u2013 You pay AWS KMS charges to generate and retrieve data keys used for encryption and decryption. Visit the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/\">AWS KMS pricing page</a> for more details. In addition, when using SSE-KMS with S3 Express One Zone, S3 Bucket Keys are enabled by default for all data plane operations except for <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html\">CopyObject</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html\">UploadPartCopy</a>, and can\u2019t be disabled. This reduces the number of requests to AWS KMS by up to 99%, optimizing both performance and costs.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS CloudTrail integration</strong> \u2013 You can audit SSE-KMS actions on S3 Express One Zone objects using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/es/cloudtrail/\">AWS CloudTrail</a>. Learn more about that in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/aws/monitor-data-events-in-amazon-s3-express-one-zone-with-aws-cloudtrail/\">my previous blog post.</a></p> \n<p>\u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizfue/\">Eli.</a></p>"

        "content": "<p>Zero-ETL integrations help unify your data across applications and data sources for holistic insights and breaking data silos. They provide a fully managed, no-code, near real-time solution for making petabytes of transactional data available in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/\">Amazon Redshift</a> within seconds of data being written into <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/\">Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MySQL</a>. This eliminates the need to create your own ETL jobs simplifying data ingestion, reducing your operational overhead and potentially lowering your overall data processing costs. Last year, we announced the general availability of zero-ETL integration with Amazon Redshift for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/\">Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition</a> as well as the availability in preview of Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, and RDS for MySQL.</p> \n<p>I am happy to announce that Amazon RDS for MySQL zero-ETL with Amazon Redshift is now generally available.

A typical use case is to reduce data processing and storage costs by selecting only the subset of data needed to replicate from their production databases. Another is to exclude personally identifiable information (PII) from a report\u2019s dataset. For example, a business in healthcare might want to exclude sensitive patient information when replicating data to build aggregate reports analyzing recent patient cases. Similarly, an e-commerce store may want to make customer spending patterns available to their marketing department, but exclude any identifying information. Conversely, there are certain cases when you might not want to use filtering, such as when making data available to fraud detection teams that need all the data in near real time to make inferences. These are just a few examples, so I encourage you to experiment and discover different use cases that might apply to your organization.</p> \n<p>There are two ways to enable filtering in your zero-ETL integrations: when you first create the integration or by modifying an existing integration. Either way, you will find this option on the \u201cSource\u201d step of the zero-ETL creation wizard.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/07/22/zero-etl-filtering-screenshot.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86875 size-full\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/07/22/zero-etl-filtering-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Interface for adding data filtering expressions to include or exclude databases or tables.\" width=\"3128\" height=\"1779\"></a></p> \n<p>You apply filters by entering filter expressions that can be used to either include or exclude databases or tables from the dataset in the format of database*.table*. You can add multiple expressions and they will be evaluated in order from left to right.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re modifying an existing integration, the new filtering rules will apply from that point in time on after you confirm your changes and Amazon Redshift will drop tables that are no longer part of the filter.</p> \n<p>If you want to dive deeper, I recommend you read this blog post, which goes in depth into <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/announcing-data-filtering-for-amazon-aurora-mysql-zero-etl-integration-with-amazon-redshift/\">how you can set up data filters for Amazon Aurora zero-ETL integrations</a> since the steps and concepts are very similar.</p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Create multiple zero-ETL integrations from a single database<br> </strong></span>You are now also able to configure up integrations from a single RDS for MySQL database to up to 5 Amazon Redshift data warehouses. The only requirement is that you must wait for the first integration to finish setting up successfully before adding others.</p> \n<p>This allows you to share transactional data with different teams while providing them ownership over their own data warehouses for their specific use cases. For example, you can also use this in conjunction with data filtering to fan out different sets of data to development, staging, and production Amazon Redshift clusters from the same Amazon RDS production database.</p> \n<p>Another interesting scenario where this could be really useful is consolidation of Amazon Redshift clusters by using zero-ETL to replicate to different warehouses. You could also use Amazon Redshift materialized views to explore your data, power your <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/\">Amazon Quicksight</a> dashboards, share data, train jobs in Amazon SageMaker, and more.</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conclusion</span><br> </strong>RDS for MySQL zero-ETL integrations with Amazon Redshift allows you to replicate data for near real-time analytics without needing to build and manage complex data pipelines. It is generally available today with the ability to add filter expressions to include or exclude databases and tables from the replicated data sets. You can now also set up multiple integrations from the same source RDS for MySQL database to different Amazon Redshift warehouses or create integrations from different sources to consolidate data into one data warehouse.</p> \n<p>This zero-ETL integration is available for RDS for MySQL versions 8.0.32 and later, Amazon Redshift Serverless, and Amazon Redshift RA3 instance types in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RDS_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.ZeroETL.html\">supported AWS Regions.</a></p> \n<p>In addition to using the AWS Management Console, you can also set up a zero-ETL integration via the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and by using an AWS SDK such as boto3, the official AWS SDK for Python.</p> \n<p>See the documentation to learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/zero-etl.html\">working with zero-ETL integrations</a>.</p> \n<p>\u2014 <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@codingmatheus\">Matheus Guimaraes</a></p>"

        "content": "<p>Today, we are pleased to announce <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-eks.html\">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) support in Amazon SageMaker HyperPod</a> \u2014 purpose-built infrastructure engineered with resilience at its core for foundation model (FM) development. This new capability enables customers to orchestrate HyperPod clusters using EKS, combining the power of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\">Kubernetes</a> with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/hyperpod/\">Amazon SageMaker HyperPod</a>\u2018s resilient environment designed for training large models. Amazon SageMaker HyperPod helps efficiently scale across more than a thousand artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators, reducing training time by up to 40%.</p> \n<p>Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now enables customers to manage their clusters using a Kubernetes-based interface. This integration allows seamless switching between Slurm and Amazon EKS for optimizing various workloads, including training, fine-tuning, experimentation, and inference. The CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities, offering insights into CPU, network, disk, and other low-level node metrics on a unified dashboard. This enhanced observability extends to resource utilization across the entire cluster, node-level metrics, pod-level performance, and container-specific utilization data, facilitating efficient troubleshooting and optimization.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-sagemaker-hyperpod-a-purpose-built-infrastructure-for-distributed-training-at-scale/\">Launched at re:Invent 2023</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/hyperpod/\">Amazon SageMaker HyperPod</a> has become a go-to solution for AI startups and enterprises looking to efficiently train and deploy large scale models. It is compatible with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/distributed-training.html\">SageMaker\u2019s distributed training libraries</a>, which offer <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-intro.html\">Model Parallel</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-parallel.html\">Data Parallel</a> software optimizations that help reduce training time by up to 20%. SageMaker HyperPod automatically detects and repairs or replaces faulty instances, enabling data scientists to train models uninterrupted for weeks or months. This allows data scientists to focus on model development, rather than managing infrastructure.</p> \n<p>The integration of Amazon EKS with Amazon SageMaker HyperPod uses the advantages of Kubernetes, which has become popular for machine learning (ML) workloads due to its scalability and rich open-source tooling. Organizations often standardize on Kubernetes for building applications, including those required for generative AI use cases, as it allows reuse of capabilities across environments while meeting compliance and governance standards. Today\u2019s announcement enables customers to scale and optimize resource utilization across more than a thousand AI accelerators. This flexibility enhances the developer experience, containerized app management, and dynamic scaling for FM training and inference workloads.</p> \n<p>Amazon EKS support in Amazon SageMaker HyperPod strengthens resilience through deep health checks, automated node recovery, and job auto-resume capabilities, ensuring uninterrupted training for large scale and/or long-running jobs. Job management can be streamlined with the optional <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-hyperpod-cli\">HyperPod CLI</a>, designed for Kubernetes environments, though customers can also use their own CLI tools. Integration with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html\">Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights</a> provides advanced observability, offering deeper insights into cluster performance, health, and utilization. Additionally, data scientists can use tools like Kubeflow for automated ML workflows. The integration also includes Amazon SageMaker managed MLflow, providing a robust solution for experiment tracking and model management.</p> \n<p>At a high level, Amazon SageMaker HyperPod cluster is created by the cloud admin using the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-ref.html#sagemaker-hyperpod-ref-api\">HyperPod cluster API</a> and is fully managed by the HyperPod service, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in building and optimizing ML infrastructure. Amazon EKS is used to orchestrate these HyperPod nodes, similar to how Slurm orchestrates HyperPod nodes, providing customers with a familiar Kubernetes-based administrator experience.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/09/04/hyperpod-eks-diagram.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87631 size-large\" style=\"border: 1px black solid;\" title=\"Amazon SageMaker HyperPod Architecture - EKS\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/09/04/hyperpod-eks-diagram-1024x905.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"905\"></a></p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Let\u2019s explore how to get started with Amazon EKS support in Amazon SageMaker HyperPod</strong></span><br> I start by preparing the scenario, checking the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-eks-prerequisites.html\">prerequisites</a>, and creating an Amazon EKS cluster with a single <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a> stack following the <a href=\"https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/2433d39e-ccfe-4c00-9d3d-9917b729258e\">Amazon SageMaker HyperPod EKS workshop</a>, configured with VPC and storage resources.</p> \n<p>To create and manage Amazon SageMaker HyperPod clusters, I can use either the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/console/\">AWS Management Console</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</a>. Using the AWS CLI, I specify my cluster configuration in a JSON file. I choose the Amazon EKS cluster created previously as the orchestrator of the SageMaker HyperPod Cluster.

For example, Amazon Q Developer helps with code suggestions and transformation, testing and security, as well as feature development. Its operations are geographically diverse, and its clients are of all sizes. AWS is focused on delivering AI-driven solutions that enhance the software development life cycle (SDLC), automating complex tasks, optimizing performance, ensuring security, and driving innovation.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>My team focuses on creating content on Amazon Q Developer that directly supports software developers\u2019 jobs-to-be-done, enabled and enhanced by generative AI in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/generative-ai/amazon-q/\">Amazon Q Developer Center</a> and <a href=\"https://community.aws/amazon-q\">Community.aws</a>.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve had the chance to talk with our customers to ask why they choose Amazon Q Developer. They said it is available to accelerate and complete tasks across the SDLC much more than general AI code assistants\u2014from coding, testing, and upgrading, to troubleshooting, performing security scanning and fixes, optimizing AWS resources, and creating data engineering pipelines.</p> \n<p>Here are the highlights that customers talked about more often:</p> \n<p><strong>Available everywhere you need it</strong> \u2013 You can use Amazon Q Developer in any of the following integrated development environment (IDE), including <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.amazon-q-vscode\">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24267-amazon-q/\">JetBrains IDEs</a>, <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.AWSToolkitforVisualStudio2022\">AWS Toolkit with Amazon Q</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/jupyterlab-setup.html\">JupyterLab</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/emr-setup.html\">Amazon EMR Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/sagemaker-setup.html\">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a>, or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/glue-setup.html\">AWS Glue Studio</a>.

According to Safe Software, \u201cAmazon Q knows all the ways to make use of the many tools that AWS provides. Because we are now able to accomplish more, we will be able to extend our automations into other AWS services and make use of Amazon Q to help us get there.\u201d To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/features/\">Amazon Q Developer features</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/customers/#Amazon_Q_Developer_customers\">Amazon Q Developer customers</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Customizing code recommendations</strong> \u2013 You can get code recommendations based on your internal code base. Amazon Q Developer accelerates onboarding to a new code base to generate even more relevant inline code recommendations and chat responses (in preview) by making it aware of your internal libraries, APIs, best practices, and architectural patterns. Your organization\u2019s administrators can securely connect Amazon Q Developer to your internal code bases to create multiple customizations. According to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/customize/#product-customers\">National Australia Bank (NAB)</a>, NAB has now added specific suggestions using the Amazon Q customization capability that are tailored to the NAB coding standards.

        "content": "<p>Today we are announcing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pcs\">AWS Parallel Computing Service (AWS PCS)</a>, a new managed service that helps customers set up and manage <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/\">high performance computing (HPC)</a> clusters so they seamlessly run their simulations at virtually any scale on AWS. Using the <a href=\"https://slurm.schedmd.com/man_index.html\">Slurm</a> scheduler, they can work in a familiar HPC environment, accelerating their time to results instead of worrying about infrastructure.</p> \n<p>In November 2018, we introduced <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/AWSParallelCluster/\">AWS ParallelCluster</a>, an AWS supported open-source cluster management tool that helps you to deploy and manage HPC clusters in the AWS Cloud. With AWS ParallelCluster, customers can also quickly build and deploy proof of concept and production HPC compute environments. They can use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/commands-v3.html\">AWS ParallelCluster Command-Line interface</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/api-ref-v3.html\">API</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/pc-py-library-v3.html\">Python library</a>, and the user interface installed from open source packages. They are responsible for updates, which can include tearing down and redeploying clusters. Many customers, though, have asked us for a fully managed AWS service to eliminate operational jobs in building and operating HPC environments.</p> \n<p>AWS PCS simplifies HPC environments managed by AWS and is accessible through the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/pcs\">AWS Management Console</a>, AWS SDK, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli\">AWS Command-Line Interface (AWS CLI)</a>. Your system administrators can create managed Slurm clusters that use their compute and storage configurations, identity, and job allocation preferences. AWS PCS uses Slurm, a highly scalable, fault-tolerant job scheduler used across a wide range of HPC customers, for scheduling and orchestrating simulations. End users such as scientists, researchers, and engineers can log in to AWS PCS clusters to run and manage HPC jobs, use interactive software on virtual desktops, and access data. You can bring their workloads to AWS PCS quickly, without significant effort to port code.</p> \n<p>You can use fully managed <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/dcv/\">NICE DCV</a> remote desktops for remote visualization, and access job telemetry or application logs to enable specialists to manage your HPC workflows in one place.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87272\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/21/2024-aws-pcs-1-diagram.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1984\" height=\"1114\"></p> \n<p>AWS PCS is designed for a wide range of traditional and emerging, compute or data-intensive, engineering and scientific workloads across areas such as computational fluid dynamics, weather modeling, finite element analysis, electronic design automation, and reservoir simulations using familiar ways of preparing, executing, and analyzing simulations and computations.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Getting started with AWS Parallel Computing Service</u></strong><br> To try out AWS PCS, you can use our <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started.html\">tutorial for creating a simple cluster</a> in the AWS documentation. First, you create a virtual private cloud (VPC) with an AWS CloudFormation template and shared storage in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/efs\">Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)</a> within your account for the AWS Region where you will try AWS PCS. To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_create-vpc.html\">Create a VPC</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_create-efs.html\">Create shared storage</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p><strong>1. Create a cluster</strong><br> In the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/pcs/home\">AWS PCS console</a>, choose <strong>Create cluster</strong>, a persistent resource for managing resources and running workloads.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87277\" style=\"width: 100%; border: solid 1px #ccc;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/21/2024-aws-pcs-2-cluster-list.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2258\" height=\"626\"></p> \n<p>Next, enter your cluster name and choose the controller size of your Slurm scheduler. You can choose <strong>Small</strong> (up to 32 nodes and 256 jobs), <strong>Medium</strong> (up to 512 nodes and 8,192 jobs), or <strong>Large</strong> (up to 2,048 nodes and 16,384 jobs) for the limits of cluster workloads. In the <strong>Networking</strong> section, choose your created VPC, subnet to launch the cluster, and security group applied to your cluster.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87276\" style=\"width: 90%; border: solid 1px #ccc;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/21/2024-aws-pcs-3-create-a-cluster.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1693\" height=\"2540\"></p> \n<p>Optionally, you can set the Slurm configuration such as an idle time before compute nodes will scale down, a Prolog and Epilog scripts directory on launched compute nodes, and a resource selection algorithm parameter used by Slurm.</p> \n<p>Choose <strong>Create cluster</strong>. It takes some time for the cluster to be provisioned.</p> \n<p><strong>2. Create compute node groups</strong><br> After creating your cluster, you can create compute node groups, a virtual collection of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a> instances that AWS PCS uses to provide interactive access to a cluster or run jobs in a cluster. When you define a compute node group, you specify common traits such as EC2 instance types, minimum and maximum instance count, target VPC subnets, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/working-with_ami.html\">Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</a>, purchase option, and custom launch configuration. Compute node groups require an instance profile to pass an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> role to an EC2 instance and an EC2 launch template that AWS PCS uses to configure EC2 instances it launches. To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_create-cng_launch-templates.html\">Create a launch template</a> And <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_create-cng_instance-profile.html\">Create an instance profile</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p>To create a compute node group in the console, go to your cluster and choose the <strong>Compute node groups</strong> tab and the <strong>Create compute node group</strong> button.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87273\" style=\"width: 90%; border: solid 1px #ccc;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/21/2024-aws-pcs-4-compute-node-groups.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1855\" height=\"1445\"></p> \n<p>You can create two compute node groups: a login node group to be accessed by end users and a job node group to run HPC jobs.</p> \n<p>To create a compute node group running HPC jobs, enter a compute node name and select a previously-created EC2 launch template, IAM instance profile, and subnets to launch compute nodes in your cluster VPC.</p> \n<p>Next, choose your preferred EC2 instance types to use when launching compute nodes and the minimum and maximum instance count for scaling. I chose the <code>hpc6a.48xlarge</code> instance type and scale limit up to eight instances. For a login node, you can choose a smaller instance, such as one <code>c6i.xlarge</code> instance. You can also choose either the <strong>On-demand</strong> or <strong>Spot</strong> EC2 purchase option if the instance type supports. Optionally, you can choose a specific AMI.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87275\" style=\"width: 90%; border: solid 1px #ccc;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/21/2024-aws-pcs-5-create-compute-note-group.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1678\" height=\"3112\"></p> \n<p>Choose <strong>Create</strong>. It takes some time for the compute node group to be provisioned. To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_create-cng_workers.html\">Create a compute node group to run jobs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_create-cng_login-nodes.html\">Create a compute node group for login nodes</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p><strong>3. Create and run your HPC jobs</strong><br> After creating your compute node groups, you submit a job to a queue to run it. The job remains in the queue until AWS PCS schedules it to run on a compute node group, based on available provisioned capacity. Each queue is associated with one or more compute node groups, which provide the necessary EC2 instances to do the processing.</p> \n<p>To create a queue in the console, go to your cluster and choose the <strong>Queues</strong> tab and the <strong>Create queue</strong> button.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87281\" style=\"width: 90%; border: solid 1px #ccc;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/21/2024-aws-pcs-create-a-queue.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1838\" height=\"586\"></p> \n<p>Enter your queue name and choose your compute node groups assigned to your queue.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87282\" style=\"width: 90%; border: solid 1px #ccc;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/21/2024-aws-pcs-create-a-queue-detail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1324\"></p> \n<p>Choose <strong>Create</strong> and wait while the queue is being created.</p> \n<p>When the login compute node group is active, you can use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/\">AWS Systems Manager</a> to connect to the EC2 instance it created. Go to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon EC2 console</a> and choose your EC2 instance of the login compute node group. To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_create-queue.html\">Create a queue to submit and manage jobs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_connect.html\">Connect to your cluster</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87308\" style=\"width: 100%; border: solid 1px #ccc;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/21/2024-aws-pcs-login-instance-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2170\" height=\"674\"></p> \n<p>To run a job using Slurm, you prepare a submission script that specifies the job requirements and submit it to a queue with the <code>sbatch</code> command. Typically, this is done from a shared directory so the login and compute nodes have a common space for accessing files.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87278\" style=\"width: 100%; border: solid 1px #ccc;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/21/2024-aws-pcs-run-jobs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1656\" height=\"1119\"></p> \n<p>You can also run a message passing interface (MPI) job in AWS PCS using Slurm. To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_run-job.html\">Run a single node job with Slurm</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_run-mpi-job.html\">Run a multi-node MPI job with Slurm</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p>You can connect a fully-managed NICE DCV remote desktop for visualization. To get started, use the CloudFormation template from <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-hpc-recipes/tree/main/recipes/pcs/cfd_cluster\">HPC Recipes for AWS GitHub repository</a>.</p> \n<p>In this example, I used the <a href=\"https://www.openfoam.com/\">OpenFOAM</a> <a href=\"https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/tree/master/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/motorBike\">motorBike simulation</a> to calculate the steady flow around a motorcycle and rider. This simulation was run with 288 cores of three hpc6a instances. The output can be visualized in the <a href=\"https://www.paraview.org/\">ParaView</a> session after logging in to the web interface of DCV instance.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87280\" style=\"width: 100%; border: solid 1px #ccc;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/21/2024-aws-pcs-nice-dcv-paraview.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2466\" height=\"1486\"></p> \n<p>Finally, after you are done HPC jobs with the cluster and node groups that you created, you should delete the resources that you created to avoid unnecessary charges.

With this feature, you can now simplify how distributed applications with multiple clients concurrently update data in parallel across shared datasets. Each client can conditionally write objects, making sure that it does not overwrite any objects already written by another client.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/aws-lambda-introduces-recursive-loop-detection-apis/\">AWS Lambda introduces recursive loop detection APIs</a> \u2013 With the recursive loop detection APIs you can now set recursive loop detection configuration on individual <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> functions. This allows you to turn off recursive loop detection on functions that intentionally use recursive patterns, avoiding disruption of these workloads. Using these APIs, you can avoid disruption to any intentionally recursive workflows as Lambda expands support of recursive loop detection to other AWS services. Configure recursive loop detection for Lambda functions through the Lambda Console, the AWS command line interface (CLI), or Infrastructure as Code tools like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/\">AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)</a>, or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/\">AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)</a>.

Using the batch API makes it more efficient to run inference with foundation models (FMs). It also allows you to aggregate responses and analyze them in batches.

As I like to describe it, an EC2 Mac instance has all the things I love from Amazon EC2 (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/\">Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</a> volumes, snapshots, virtual private clouds (VPCs), security groups, and more) applied to Mac minis running macOS in the cloud.</p> \n<p>However, customers are left with two challenges. The first is to prepare the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with all the required tools for the build. A minimum build environment requires Xcode, but it is very common to install <a href=\"https://fastlane.tools/\">Fastlane</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby</a>), as well as other build or development tools and libraries. Most organizations require multiple build environments for multiple combinations of macOS and Xcode versions.</p> \n<p>The second challenge is to scale your build fleet according to the number and duration of builds. Large organizations typically have hundreds or thousands of builds per day, requiring dozens of build machines. Scaling in and out of that fleet helps to save on costs. EC2 Mac instances are reserved for your dedicated use. One instance is allocated to one dedicated host. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/implementing-autoscaling-for-ec2-mac-instances/\">Scaling a fleet of dedicated hosts</a> requires a specific configuration.</p> \n<p>To address these challenges and simplify the configuration and management of your macOS build machines, today we introduce CodeBuild for macOS.</p> \n<p>CodeBuild for macOS is based on the recently introduced <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/fleets.html\">reserved capacity fleet</a>, which contains instances powered by Amazon EC2 that are maintained by CodeBuild. With reserved capacity fleets, you configure a set of dedicated instances for your build environment. These machines remain idle, ready to process builds or tests immediately, which reduces build durations. With reserved capacity fleets, your machines are always running and will continue to incur costs as long as they\u2019re provisioned.</p> \n<p>CodeBuild provides a standard disk image (AMI) to run your builds. It contains preinstalled versions of Xcode, Fastlane, Ruby, Python, Node.js, and other popular tools for a development and build environment. The full <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/available-runtimes.html#macOS-runtimes\">list of tools installed</a> is available in the documentation. Over time, we will provide additional disk images with updated versions of these tools. You can also bring your own custom disk image if you desire.</p> \n<p>In addition, CodeBuild makes it easy to configure auto scaling. You tell us how much capacity you want, and we manage everything from there.</p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Let\u2019s see CodeBuild for macOS in action<br> </strong></span>To show you how it works, I create a CI/CD pipeline for my pet project: getting started with <a href=\"https://aws-amplify.github.io/\">AWS Amplify</a> on iOS. This tutorial and its accompanying source code explain how to create a simple iOS app with a cloud-based backend. The app uses a GraphQL API (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/\">AWS AppSync</a>), a NoSQL database (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\">Amazon DynamoDB</a>), a file-based storage (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>), and user authentication (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\">Amazon Cognito</a>). <a href=\"https://docs.amplify.aws/swift/\">AWS Amplify for Swift</a> is the piece that glues all these services together.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/sebsto/amplify-ios-getting-started\">tutorial and the source code of the app are available in a Git repository</a>. It includes <a href=\"https://github.com/sebsto/amplify-ios-getting-started/tree/main/code/ci_actions\">scripts to automate the build, test, and deployment of the app</a>.</p> \n<p>Configuring a new CI/CD pipeline with CodeBuild for macOS involves the following high-level steps:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Create the build project.</li> \n <li>Create the dedicated fleet of machines.</li> \n <li>Configure one or more build triggers.</li> \n <li>Add a pipeline definition file (<code>buildspec.yaml</code>) to the project.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>To get started, I open the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com\">AWS Management Console</a>, select CodeBuild, and select <strong>Create project</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/05/2024-08-02_10-19-52.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87073\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/05/2024-08-02_10-19-52.png\" alt=\"codebuild mac - 1\" width=\"800\" height=\"346\"></a></p> \n<p>I enter a <strong>Project name</strong> and configure the connection to the <strong>Source</strong> code repository.

I select <strong>Create fleet</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/05/2024-08-02_10-25-01.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87077\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/05/2024-08-02_10-25-01.png\" alt=\"codebuild mac - 3\" width=\"800\" height=\"641\"></a></p> \n<p>On the <strong>Compute fleet configuration</strong> page, I enter a <strong>Compute fleet name</strong>&nbsp;and select <strong>macOS</strong> as <strong>Operating system</strong>. Under <strong>Compute</strong>, I select the amount of memory and the quantity of vCPUs needed for my build project, and the number of instances I want under <strong>Capacity</strong>.</p> \n<p>For this example, I am happy to use the <strong>Managed image</strong>.

This is not specific to CodeBuild. The builds you submit during the machine preparation time are queued and will be run in order as soon as the machine is available.</p> \n<p>CodeBuild for macOS works with reserved fleets. Contrary to on-demand fleets, where you pay per minute of build, reserved fleets are charged for the time the build machines are reserved for your exclusive usage, even when no builds are running. The capacity reservation follows the Amazon EC2 Mac 24-hour minimum allocation period, as required by the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSSonoma.pdf\">Software License Agreement for macOS</a> (article 3.A.ii).</p> \n<p>A fleet of machines can be shared across CodeBuild projects on your AWS account. The machines in the fleet are reserved for your exclusive use. Only CodeBuild can access the machines.</p> \n<p>CodeBuild cleans the working directory between builds, but the machines are reused for other builds. It allows you to use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-caching.html#caching-local\">CodeBuild local cache mechanism</a> to quickly restore selected files after a build. If you build different projects on the same fleet, be sure to reset any global state, such as the <a href=\"https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/security/\">macOS keychain</a>, and build artifacts, such as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72788019/where-is-swift-package-manager-cache-located-swift-5-7\">the SwiftPM and Xcode package caches</a>, before starting a new build.</p> \n<p>When you work with custom build images, be sure they are built for a 64-bit Mac-Arm architecture. You also must install and start the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent-macos.html\">AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent)</a>. CodeBuild uses the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html\">SSM Agent</a> to install its own agent and to manage the machine. Finally, make sure the AMI is available to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/fleets.html#ami\">the CodeBuild organization ARN</a>.</p> \n<p>CodeBuild for macOS is available in the following <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#region\">AWS Regions</a>: US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Europe (Frankfurt).

Prime members shopped for millions of deals and saved billions across more than 35 categories globally.</p> \n<p>I live in South Korea, but luckily I was staying in Seattle to attend the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/\">AWS Heroes Summit</a> during Prime Day 2024. I signed up for a <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/how-to-sign-up-for-a-prime-membership\">Prime membership</a> and used <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus\">Rufus</a>, my new AI-powered conversational shopping assistant, to search for items quickly and easily. Prime members in the U.S. like me chose to consolidate their deliveries on millions of orders during Prime Day, saving an estimated 10 million trips. This consolidation results in lower carbon emissions on average.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87007\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/07/29/2024-amazon-primeday-powered-by-aws.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\"></p> \n<p>We know from Jeff\u2019s annual blog post that AWS runs the Amazon website and mobile app that makes these short-term, large scale global events feasible. (check out his <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/how-aws-powered-amazons-biggest-day-ever/\">2016</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prime-day-2017-powered-by-aws/\">2017</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-prime-day-2019-powered-by-aws/\">2019</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-prime-day-2020-powered-by-aws/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prime-day-2021-two-chart-topping-days/\">2021</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-prime-day-2022-aws-for-the-win/\">2022</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prime-day-2023-powered-by-aws-all-the-numbers/\">2023</a> posts for a look back). Today I want to share top numbers from AWS that made my amazing shopping experience possible.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Prime Day 2024 \u2013 all the numbers</u></strong><br> Here are some of the most interesting and/or mind-blowing metrics:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\"><strong>Amazon EC2</strong></a> \u2013 Since many of <a href=\"http://amazon.com/\">Amazon.com</a> services such as Rufus and Search use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/\">AWS artificial intelligence</a> (AI) chips under the hood, Amazon deployed a cluster of over 80,000 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/\">Inferentia</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/\">Trainium</a> chips for Prime Day. During Prime Day 2024, Amazon used over 250K <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/\">AWS Graviton</a> chips to power more than 5,800 distinct Amazon.com services (double that of 2023).</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs\"><strong>Amazon EBS </strong></a>\u2013 In support of Prime Day, Amazon provisioned 264 PiB of Amazon EBS storage in 2024, a 62 percent increase compared to 2023. When compared to the day before Prime Day 2024, Amazon.com performance on Amazon EBS jumped by 5.6 trillion read/write I/O operations during the event, or an increase of 64 percent compared to Prime Day 2023. Also, when compared to the day before Prime Day 2024, Amazon.com transferred an incremental 444 petabytes of data during the event, or an increase of 81 percent compared to Prime Day 2023.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87005\" style=\"width: 80%;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/07/29/Prime-Day-2024_EBS-visual_v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2098\" height=\"1180\"></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/aurora\"><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong></a> \u2013 On Prime Day, 6,311 database instances running the PostgreSQL-compatible and MySQL-compatible editions of Amazon Aurora processed more than 376 billion transactions, stored 2,978 terabytes of data, and transferred 913 terabytes of data.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb\"><strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong></a> \u2013 DynamoDB powers multiple high-traffic Amazon properties and systems including Alexa, the Amazon.com sites, and all Amazon fulfillment centers. Over the course of Prime Day, these sources made tens of trillions of calls to the DynamoDB API. DynamoDB maintained high availability while delivering single-digit millisecond responses and peaking at 146 million requests per second.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache\"><strong>Amazon ElastiCache</strong></a> \u2013 ElastiCache served more than quadrillion requests on a single day with a peak of over 1 trillion requests per minute.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight\"><strong>Amazon QuickSight</strong></a> \u2013 Over the course of Prime Day 2024, one Amazon QuickSight dashboard used by Prime Day teams saw 107K unique hits, 1300+ unique visitors, and delivered over 1.6M queries.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker\"><strong>Amazon SageMaker </strong></a>\u2013 SageMaker processed more than 145B inference requests during Prime Day.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses\"><strong>Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)</strong> </a>\u2013 SES sent 30 percent more emails for Amazon.com during Prime Day 2024 vs 2023, delivering 99.23 percent of those emails to customers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty\"><strong>Amazon GuardDuty </strong></a>\u2013 During Prime Day 2024, Amazon GuardDuty monitored nearly 6 trillion log events per hour, a 31.9% increase from the previous year\u2019s Prime Day.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail\"><strong>AWS CloudTrail</strong></a> \u2013 CloudTrail processed over 976 billion events in support of Prime Day 2024.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront\"><strong>Amazon CloudFront </strong></a>\u2013 CloudFront handled a peak load of over 500 million HTTP requests per minute, for a total of over 1.3 trillion HTTP requests during Prime Day 2024, a 30 percent increase in total requests compared to Prime Day 2023.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Prepare to Scale</u></strong><br> As Jeff noted in every year, rigorous preparation is key to the success of Prime Day and our other large-scale events. For example, 733 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fis\">AWS Fault Injection Service</a> experiments were run to test resilience and ensure Amazon.com remains highly available on Prime Day.</p> \n<p>If you are preparing for a similar business-critical events, product launches, and migrations, I strongly recommend that you take advantage of newly-branded <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/aws-countdown/\">AWS Countdown</a>, a support program designed for your project lifecycle to assess operational readiness, identify and mitigate risks, and plan capacity, using proven playbooks developed by AWS experts. For example, with additional help from AWS Countdown, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo3HrxDU-HM\">Legal Zoom</a> successfully migrated 450 servers with minimal issues and continues to leverage <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/aws-countdown/\">AWS Countdown Premium</a> to streamline and expedite the launch of SaaS applications.</p> \n<p>We look forward to seeing what other records will be broken next year!</p> \n<p>\u2014 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/channyun\">Channy</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffbarr\">Jeff</a>;</p>"

Dr. Swami said he viewed <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/\">Amazon SageMaker</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> as prime examples of successful products that have emerged as a result of this customer-first approach. \u201cIf you end up chasing your competitors, you are going to end up building what they are building,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you actually listen to your customers, you are actually going to lead the way in innovation.\u201d To learn four more lessons on customer-obsessed innovation, visit our <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/careers/life-at-aws-four-lessons-on-customer-obsessed-innovation-from-two-amazon-leaders/?trk=8b08cf2c-62d8-4915-9baf-67b8c25d58ef&amp;sc_channel=sm\">AWS Careers blog</a>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87153 alignright\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/09/CJ_Moses.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"107\" height=\"160\">For example, for customer-obsessed security, we build and use Mithra, a powerful neural network model to detect and respond to cyber threats.

        "content": "<p>Today, we are announcing the general availability of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/\">Amazon Titan Image Generator v2 model</a> with new capabilities in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. With Amazon Titan Image Generator v2, you can guide image creation using reference images, edit existing visuals, remove backgrounds, generate image variations, and securely customize the model to maintain brand style and subject consistency. This powerful tool streamlines workflows, boosts productivity, and brings creative visions to life.</p> \n<p>Amazon Titan Image Generator v2 brings a number of new features in addition to all features of Amazon Titan Image Generator v1, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Image conditioning</strong> \u2013 Provide a reference image along with a text prompt, resulting in outputs that follow the layout and structure of the user-supplied reference.</li> \n <li><strong>Image guidance with color palette</strong> \u2013 Control precisely the color palette of generated images by providing a list of hex codes along with the text prompt.</li> \n <li><strong>Background removal</strong> \u2013 Automatically remove background from images containing multiple objects.</li> \n <li><strong>Subject consistency</strong> \u2013 Fine-tune the model to preserve a specific subject (for example, a particular dog, shoe, or handbag) in the generated images.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><u>New features in Amazon Titan Image Generator v2</u></strong><br> Before getting started, if you are new to using Amazon Titan models, go to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock console</a> and choose <strong>Model access </strong>on the bottom left pane. To access the latest Amazon Titan models from <strong>Amazon</strong>, request access separately for <strong>Amazon Titan Image Generator G1 v2</strong>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87050\" style=\"width: 100%;border: solid 1px #ccc\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/01/2024-image-generator-v2-model-access.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2288\" height=\"1112\"></p> \n<p>Here are details of the Amazon Titan Image Generator v2 in Amazon Bedrock:</p> \n<p><strong>Image conditioning</strong><br> You can use the image conditioning feature to shape your creations with precision and intention. By providing a reference image (that is, a conditioning image), you can instruct the model to focus on specific visual characteristics, such as edges, object outlines, and structural elements, or segmentation maps that define distinct regions and objects within the reference image.</p> \n<p>We support two types of image conditioning: Canny edge and segmentation.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The Canny edge algorithm is used to extract the prominent edges within the reference image, creating a map that the Amazon Titan Image Generator can then use to guide the generation process. You can \u201cdraw\u201d the foundations of your desired image, and the model will then fill in the details, textures, and final aesthetic based on your guidance.</li> \n <li>Segmentation provides an even more granular level of control. By supplying the reference image, you can define specific areas or objects within the image and instruct the Amazon Titan Image Generator to generate content that aligns with those defined regions. You can precisely control the placement and rendering of characters, objects, and other key elements.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Here are generation examples that use image conditioning.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87051\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/01/2024-image-generator-v2-1-color-conditioning.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1952\" height=\"1178\"></p> \n<p>To use the image conditioning feature, you can use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/welcome.html\">Amazon Bedrock API</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/\">AWS SDK</a>, or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</a> and choose <code>CANNY_EDGE</code> or <code>SEGMENTATION</code> for <code>controlMode</code> of <code>textToImageParams</code> with your reference image.<strong><br> </strong></p> \n<pre><code class=\"lang-python\">\t\"taskType\": \"TEXT_IMAGE\",\n\t\"textToImageParams\": {\n \t\t\"text\": \"a cartoon deer in a fairy world.\",\n        \"conditionImage\": input_image, # Optional\n        \"controlMode\": \"CANNY_EDGE\" # Optional: CANNY_EDGE | SEGMENTATION\n        \"controlStrength\": 0.7 # Optional: weight given to the condition image.

You can also provide a reference image as input (optional) to generate an image with provided hex colors while inheriting style from the reference image.</p> \n<p>In this example, the prompt describes:<br> <code>a jar of salad dressing in a rustic kitchen surrounded by fresh vegetables with studio lighting</code></p> \n<p>The generated image reflects both the content of the text prompt and the specified color scheme to align with the brand\u2019s color guidelines.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87054\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/01/2024-image-generator-v2-2-color-palatte.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2118\" height=\"771\"></p> \n<p>To use color conditioning feature, you can set <code>taskType</code> to <code>COLOR_GUIDED_GENERATION</code> with your prompt and hex codes.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"lang-python\"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"taskType\": \"COLOR_GUIDED_GENERATION\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"colorGuidedGenerationParams\": {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"text\": \"a jar of salad dressing in a rustic kitchen surrounded by fresh vegetables with studio lighting\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n\t         \"colors\": ['#ff8080', '#ffb280', '#ffe680', '#e5ff80'], # Optional: list of color hex codes \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \"referenceImage\": input_image, #Optional\n        }</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Background removal</strong><br> Whether you\u2019re looking to composite an image onto a solid color backdrop or layer it over another scene, the ability to cleanly and accurately remove the background is an essential tool in the creative workflow. You can instantly remove the background from your images with a single step. Amazon Titan Image Generator v2 can intelligently detect and segment multiple foreground objects, ensuring that even complex scenes with overlapping elements are cleanly isolated.</p> \n<p>The example shows an image of an iguana sitting on a tree in a forest. The model was able to identify the iguana as the main object and remove the forest background, replacing it with a transparent background. This lets the iguana stand out clearly without the distracting forest around it.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87053\" style=\"width: 90%\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/01/2024-image-generator-v2-3-background-removal.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1270\" height=\"386\"></p> \n<p>To use background removal feature, you can set <code>taskType</code> to <code>BACKGROUND_REMOVAL</code> with your input image.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"lang-python\">    \"taskType\": \"BACKGROUND_REMOVAL\",\n    \"backgroundRemovalParams\": {\n \t\t\"image\": input_image,\n    }</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Subject consistency with fine-tuning</strong><br> You can now seamlessly incorporate specific subjects into visually captivating scenes. Whether it\u2019s a brand\u2019s product, a company logo, or a beloved family pet, you can fine-tune the Amazon Titan model using reference images to learn the unique characteristics of the chosen subject.</p> \n<p>Once the model is fine-tuned, you can simply provide a text prompt, and the Amazon Titan Generator will generate images that maintain a consistent depiction of the subject, placing it naturally within diverse, imaginative contexts.

        "content": "<p>Summer is reaching its peak for some of us around the globe, and many are heading out to their favorite holiday destinations to enjoy some time off. I just came back from holidays myself and I couldn\u2019t help thinking about the key role that artificial intelligence (AI) plays in our modern world to help us scale the operation of simple things like traveling. Passport and identity verifications were quick, and thanks to the new airport security system rolling out across the world, so were my bag checks. I watched my backpack with a smile as it rolled along the security check belt with my computer, tablet, and portable game consoles all nicely tucked inside without any fuss.</p> \n<p>If it wasn\u2019t for AI, we wouldn\u2019t be able to scale operations to keep up with population growth or the enormous volumes of data we generate on a daily basis. The advent of generative AI took this even further by unlocking the ability to put all this data to use in all kinds of creative ways, driving a new wave of exciting innovations that continues to elevate modern products and services.</p> \n<p>This new landscape can be challenging for companies that are learning how generative AI can help them grow or succeed, such as startups. This is why I\u2019m so excited about the AWS GenAI Lofts taking place in the next months around the world.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/startups/lp/aws-gen-ai-lofts\">The AWS GenAI Lofts</a> are collaborative spaces available in different cities around the world for a number of weeks. Startups, developers, investors, and industry experts can meet here while having access to AWS AI experts, and attend talks, workshops, fireside chats, and Q&amp;As with industry leaders. All lofts are free and are carefully curated to offer something for everyone to help you accelerate your journey with AI. There are lofts scheduled in Bengaluru (July 29-Aug 9), San Francisco (Aug 14-Sept 27), Sao Paulo (Sept 2-Nov 20), London (Sept 30-Oct 25), Paris (Oct 8-Nov 25), and Seoul (Nov, pending exact dates). I highly encourage you to have a look at the agendas of a loft near you and drop in to learn more about GenAI and connect with others.</p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong>Last week\u2019s launches</strong></span><br> Here are some launches that got my attention last week.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Q Business cross-Region IdC \u2014 </strong><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/what-is.html\">Amazon Q Business</a> is a generative AI-powered assistant that deeply understands your business by providing connectors that you can easily set up to unify data from various sources such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon S3</a>, Microsoft 365, and more. You can then generate content, answer questions, and even automate tasks that are relevant and specific to your business. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/\">Q Business</a> integrates with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html\">AWS IAM Identity Center</a> to ensure that data can only be accessed by those who are authorized to do so. Previously, the IAM Identity Center instance had to be located in the same Region as the Q Business application. Now, you can connect to one in a different Region.</p> \n<p><strong>Git sync status changes publish to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/\">Amazon EventBridge</a></strong> \u2014 <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/git-sync.html\">AWS CloudFormation Git sync</a> is a very handy feature that can help streamline your DevOps operations by allowing you to automatically update your <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html\">AWS CloudFormation</a> stacks whenever you commit changes to the template or deployment file in source control. As of last week, any sync status change is published in near real-time as an event to EventBridge. This enables you to take your GitOps workflow further and stay on top of your Git repositories or resource sync status changes.</p> \n<p><strong>Some AWS Pinpoint\u2019s capabilities are now under <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/end-user-messaging/\">AWS End User Messaging</a></strong> \u2014 AWS Pinpoint\u2019s SMS, MMS, push, and text to voice capabilities have been shuffled and now are offered through their own service called AWS End User Messaging. There is no impact to existing applications and no changes to APIs, the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface</a> (AWS CLI), or IAM policies, however, the new name is now reflected on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/console/\">AWS Management Console</a>, AWS Billing console dashboard, documentation, and other places.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/amazon-workspaces.html\">Amazon WorkSpaces</a> updates \u2014 </strong>Microsoft Visual Studio Professional and Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2022 are now added to the list of available license included applications on Workspaces Personal. Additionally, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces-family/thin-client/\">Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client</a> has received Carbon Trust verification. As verified by the Carbon Trust, the total lifecycle carbon emission is 77kg CO2e and 50% of the product is made from recycled materials.</p> \n<p><strong>GenAI for the Public Sector \u2014 </strong>There has been two significant launches that may interest those in the public sector looking into getting started with generative AI. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> is now a FedRAMP High authorized service in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region. Additionally, both Llama 3 8B and Lllama 3 70B are now also available in that Region making this a perfect opportunity to start experimenting with Bedrock and Llama 3 if you have workloads in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region.</p> \n<p><strong>Customers in Germany can now sign up for AWS using their bank account \u2014 </strong>That means no debit or credit card is needed to create AWS accounts if you have a billing address in Germany. This can help simplify payment of AWS invoices for some businesses, as well as make it easier for others to get started on AWS.</p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong>Learning Materials</strong></span></p> \n<p>These are my recommended learning materials for this week.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Skill Builder \u2014 </strong>This is more of a broad recommendation, but I\u2019m still surprised that so many people never heard of AWS Skill Builder or have not tried it yet. There is so much learning you can do for free including a lot of hands-on courses. In July alone, <a href=\"https://skillbuilder.aws/\">AWS Skill Builder</a> has launched 25 new digital training products including <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-simulearn/\">AWS SimulLearn</a> and <a href=\"https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-other-T2-Traincert-AWS-Cloud-Quest-Gen-AI-Season1-2024-reg.html\">AWS Cloud Quest: Generative AI</a> which are game-based learning experiences. Speaking of that, did you know that if you need to renew your Cloud Practitioner certification you can do it simply by playing the <a href=\"https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/17623/aws-cloud-quest-recertify-cloud-practitioner\">AWS Cloud Quest: Recertify Cloud Practioner</a> game?</p> \n<p><strong>Get started with agentic code interpreter \u2014 </strong>Earlier last month we released a new capability on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\">Agents for Amazon Bedrock</a> which allows agents to dynamically generate and execute code within a secure sandboxed environment. As usual, my colleague <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikegchambers/\">Mike Chambers</a> has created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC_qLlm2se0\">great video</a> and <a href=\"https://community.aws/content/2jOQC6L6A4SHH89yxZv84fEvqzD/ai-running-it-s-own-code-agentic-code-interpreter?lang=en\">blog post on community.aws</a> showing how you can start using it today.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s it for this week. Check back next Monday for another Weekly Roundup!</p>"
