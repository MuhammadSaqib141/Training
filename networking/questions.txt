a) What is the address of the assigned subnetwork and what is the extended network prefix?
b) Which IP addresses can I use to configure the computers in my lab?
c) Suppose I wanted to do subdivide the assigned address block into 4 smaller subnetworks of equal size. How large are these networks, and how many IP addresses can I assign in each subnetwork?


2) 
Consider the 128.100.112.0/21 block of IP addresses. This block of addresses must be divided into four subnetworks that have each at least 500 IP addresses.
